# Using --no-rc with Bash in Aider's Run Command

When using --no-rc with bash in aider's run command, the main potential downsides would be:

1. Missing shell functions or aliases that might be needed by the command being run
2. Missing PATH modifications that were set up in .bashrc/.bash_profile
3. Missing environment variables that were set (but not exported) in the rc files

However, since aider is primarily running system commands and git operations, these downsides are likely minimal because:

1. Most system commands don't rely on shell functions/aliases
2. The basic PATH should already be exported from the parent environment
3. Critical environment variables are typically exported in the parent shell

Using --no-rc could actually be beneficial because it:

1. Provides more predictable behavior across different user environments
2. Avoids potential interference from user's custom shell configurations
3. Starts faster by skipping rc file processing
4. Reduces the chance of shell customizations affecting command output

Given aider's use case, using --no-rc is probably a good practice as it promotes consistency and reliability across different
environments while the downsides are minimal for the types of commands typically being run.
